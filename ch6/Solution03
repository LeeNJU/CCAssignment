 //I looked at the solution in the book
 This is impossible. Next we are going to prove it. For a 8 * 8 chessboard, there are 64 squares
 in the chessboard. Then we color every square with black color or white color,such that every 
 adjacent squares don't have the same color. Then we will get 32 black colors and 32 white colors.
 If we remove two diagonally opposite corners,these two squares must be the same color. Let's 
 suppose these two corners are white. So now we have 32 black squares and 30 white squares.
 We know that every domino will cover a black square and a white square. So we need 31 black squares
 and 31 white squares. However, we only have 32 black squares and 30 white squares. So it is 
 impossible.
