//I looked at the solution in the book
if these three ants move in the same direction, they will never collide with each other because their
speed is the same. So they can move in clockwise or unclockwise direction to make sure that they
don't collide with each other.  The probability that they all move in clockwise direction is
(1/2)^3, the probability that they all move in unclockwise direction is also (1/2)^3, so the probability
that they collide is 1 - 2 * (1/2)^3 = 3/4

In the situation of n ants in an n-vertex polygon, the probability that they move in the same direction
is that 2 * (1/2)^n, so the probability that they won't collide is 1 - 2 * (1/2)^n
