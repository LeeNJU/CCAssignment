//I looked at the solution in the book
If there is only one person who has blue eyes, it will take one day for this person to leave.
Because this person can see the color of other people's eyes, other people don't have blue eyes,
then this person knows that he has blue eyes.
If there are two person who have blue eyes, they can see the color of each other's eyes but they
don't know their own color. They know that if there is only one person who has blue eyes.this
person will leave on the first night. If the other person is still at the island on the second 
night, the person will know that he has blue eyes too. So is the other person. So they will both
leave the island on the second night.
If there are more than two persons who have blue eyes, let's suppose that the number of blue eyes
person is n and n > 2. If there are 3 person, it will take 3 nights for the third person to know
that he has blue eyes because he can see that the other two persons are still at the island on 
the third night. Then the third person will leave at the third night. In the same way, it will take
4 nights for the fourth person to know that he has blue eyes and so on. Then we know that if there
are n persons who have blue eyes, it will take n nights for these persons to leave.
