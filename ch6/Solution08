First we drop an egg from every Nth floor(n is even). For example, we first drop an egg from 2nd
floor, if the egg does not break, then we drop this egg from the 4th floor etc. If we drop this 
egg from nth floor and it breaks(n is even), we drop another egg from the (n - 1)th floor to see
if it breaks. If it breaks, we can find that N is n - 1. If it does not break, N is n.
