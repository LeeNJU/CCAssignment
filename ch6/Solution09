//I looked at the solution in the book
Let's take the 10th door as an example to analyze this problem. At round 1, the 10th door will be
toggled and it's open. At round 2, the 10th door will be toggled again and it will be closed.
At round 5, the 10th door will be toggled and it's open. At round 10, the 10th door will be toggled
and it will be closed. Then we can conclude that door i will be toggled for every factor of i.
And the number of factors will be odd if door i is going to be open. So we only need to find out
all the numbers which have odd number of factors. Here is a simple way to find all the numbers.
The number which has odd number of factors has to be a square number. Let's take 16 as an example.
We know that 16 = 1 * 16 = 2 * 8 = 4 * 4. So only the square numbers have odd number of factors.
So we need to find all the square numbers from i to 100, which is quite easy. These numbers are
1, 4, 9,16,25,36,49,64,81,100. So we know that there will be 10 doors left open after 100 passes.
